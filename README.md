Mathematica notebook for "The Banach-Mazur distance between C([1,\omega]) C([1,\omega 3]) is not an integer number" paper. Updated September 2023.

**Download** the notebook by clicking "Code" and "Download ZIP". (For some reason clicking on the notebook itself and then "Download" just opens the raw text in a new window.)
